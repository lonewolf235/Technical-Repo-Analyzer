# Technical-Repo-Analyzer
This project is a full stack project which takes up a github profile link and return the most technical complex repository out of it.

Technical-Repo-Analyzer is a Python tool that helps identify the most technically complex repositories on GitHub. It analyzes repositories based on code complexity parameters, including the number of nesting levels, lines of code, and the number of new paths generated. This tool assists companies and developers in prioritizing repositories that may require more attention, potentially containing errors, or needing optimization.

Additionally, we have a Streamlit-hosted web interface for this tool, making it even more accessible.

## Features

- Analyze GitHub repositories to determine technical complexity.
- Prioritize repositories based on nesting, lines of code, and branching complexity.
- Retrieve GitHub repository data using the GitHub API.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.
- Streamlit-hosted web interface for user-friendly interaction.
